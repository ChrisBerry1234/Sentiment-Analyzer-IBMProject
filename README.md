# Sentiment-Analyzer-IBMProject 2024

This is a Flask-based Web Application that analyzes client text and returns emotional scores using IBM Watson's NLP

It identifies five emotions:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Joy
- Sadness

**
⚠️ Important Note: IBM Cloud Environment Requirement**

This project must be run inside the IBM Skills Network Theia Docker environment, as required by the course.

The IBM Emotion API endpoint (sn-watson-emotion.labs.skills.network/...) is only accessible from within the IBM cloud-based Theia container.

Because of this restriction, the project cannot run locally on your machine or traditional servers.

👉 Due to this limitation, I also built a separate Emotion Detector that can run anywhere on a live server.
(This repo focuses on the IBM-locked version.)



**📘 Background**

This project was built as part of the IBM Software Engineering course during my IBM Externship, where the goal was to design, deploy, and integrate an NLP-powered backend service.
